Being so optimistic, and so close to winning, it certainly breaks my heart when there was an anouncement I didn't make it to get the scholarship. For a second I feel lost even though I already made plan b, c, d .... z.

Ofcourse I don't lose everything. I still have my parents, fully functioning body and brain, financial security, life direction, and basically I still own everything. But still, didn't win a scholarship is a big loss. 

It's an awful feeling but it's good to remember this feeling as a motivation. I think it's a wake up call for me because I admit after I graduate, my productivity rate has been declining steeply. Since my parent prefer me not to work, I often spend my time slacking at home.

I finished crying and stopped playing victim. I am privilleged by so many mercies I can't be more thankful for. I'm still young and right now, I have nothing to lose. I can be life changer, CEO, hafidz, bodybuilder, ultra dork, writer, and not to mention a student in the UK university. We will find a way. 

So, hello world. It's my new blog. Hello. I want to start something new here. Hello. I am a brand new person. Hello from the other side~
